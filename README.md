# Interactive Semantic Segmentation

Built on top of the following repositories:
- https://github.com/XavierCHEN34/ClickSEG
- https://github.com/saic-vul/ritm_interactive_segmentation

The labeling application runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac.
<br></br>
## Labeling application setup  
### Prerequisites
If you use installation option 2, first install a Conda distribution like [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). During the installation process for Miniconda (or Anaconda), check the box to add conda to your `path` environmental variable.

For more info on training models for interactive segmentation, see [ClickSeg](https://github.com/XavierCHEN34/ClickSEG) and [RITM](https://github.com/saic-vul/ritm_interactive_segmentation).

### Installation Option 1 (Automatic)
1. Clone this repository, or download and extract [the zip file](https://github.com/fogg-lab/interactive-segmentation/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to a folder. Make sure the folder you extract it to contains no spaces or the install script will fail (the reason for this is that for launching the Miniconda installer from the command line, the /D option doesn't allow any spaces).  
> 1.1 **Additional step for Mac or Linux users only**:
>   - Right-click on the project folder (the folder that contains `environment.yml` and this README file), and select `Open in terminal`, or `New terminal at folder`.  If neither of these options exist, you can do this instead:  
>     - Right-click on the project folder and copy the path  
>     - Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder by entering `cd <path to project folder>`, for example:  
>       `cd /home/user/interactive-segmentation`  
>   - In the terminal, enter a command to add the execute permission to the install and launch scripts, for example:  
>       `chmod u+x install_scripts/iseg-mac-installer.command && chmod u+x launch_scripts/iseg-mac-launcher.command`
#
2. Run the installation script for your operating system to install the labeling application:  
    - Windows: `install_scripts/iseg-windows-installer.bat` (if you get a security warning, click `More info` and then `Run anyway`)  
    - Mac: `install_scripts/iseg-mac-installer.command`  
    - Linux: `install_scripts/install_iseg.sh`

### Installation Option 2 (Manual)
1. Clone this repository, or download and extract [the zip file](https://github.com/fogg-lab/interactive-segmentation/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to a folder.  
Right-click on the project folder (the folder that contains `environment.yml` and this README file) and copy the path for the next step.
#
2. In a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `interactive-segmentation` install folder with `cd` and the path you copied in the previous step.  
    **Example**:
    ```
    cd C:\Users\username\Downloads\interactive-segmentation
    ```
#
3. Use conda to install the environment for running the labeling app.  
    ```
    conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
    conda env create -f environment.yml --solver=libmamba
    ```

#
4. Download a checkpoint file (.pth) for a trained interactive segmentation model, and move it into the checkpoints folder (e.g. `/Users/username/interactive-segmentation/checkpoints/`).  
You can download a trained model (trained for endothelial tube network segmentation) at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FL4KHsk4zUetFnAeVdwRqB5KHMth4cCx/view?usp=share_link).
<br></br>
### Usage
1. (Launch using the launch script) Double click the appropriate launch script for your operating system, located in the `launch_scripts` directory.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR

1. (Launch using the command line) Launch the application from the command line after activating the `iseg` conda environment created in step 3 of the manual installation instructions.  
From the terminal or command prompt, activate the Conda environment, navigate to the project folder, and launch the labeling app.  
    **Example**:  
    ```
    cd /Users/username/repositories/interactive-segmentation
    conda activate iseg
    python iseg.py
    ```

#
2. Load an image file in the labeling app, and optionally load an existing segmentation mask as well.
   Press the `Load image` button on the top bar to load an image file from your computer.  
   *If you have an existing mask you want to refine or continue working on, press the `Load mask` button to load it.*
#
3. Use these controls to label the image:  
    - Scroll with your mouse to zoom in/out, and right click + drag to pan around in the image.
    - Click on an object to select it for segmentation, or right click on the background to omit it from the segmentation.  
    - Use the `Toggle brush` button to switch between brush and click modes. The brush mode lets you paint on foreground (positive) and background (negative) selections. The `Erase brushstrokes` option erases both foreground and background (invisible) brushstrokes, independent from the click selection layer.  
    - Use the `Selection Transparency` (alpha blending coefficient) slider to change the transparency of the selection layer.  
    - Press `Show/Hide Mask` to show or hide the resulting segmentation mask.
#
4. Save frequently to avoid losing your work.

**Note**: If needed, configuration variables can be changed in the `config.yml` file.
